Purescript Book Notes
=====================

## General FP Notes

* Removing args towards point-free style is called _eta conversion_.


Syntax
------

### Imports

    import Prelude
    import Math as M
    import Mod (AType(..), BType(Cons2, Cons3), f, g, h)


### Data Types

Keep in mind that `Array` is the JS type, not like Haskell.

* JS types, module `Prim`: `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Array`
* PS types, module `Prim`: `Boolean`, `Int`, `Char`
* Records: `let r = { s: "Foo", i: 17, n: 2.2 }`


### Pattern Matching Literals

    * `Number`, `String`, `Char`, `Boolean`.
    * `_` matches binding to no name
    * `Array`:
        takeFive :: Array Int -> Int
        takeFive [0, 1 a, b, _] = a * b
        takeFive _ = 0
      (Note: you cannot match arrays of unspecified length, "since
      destructuring immutable arrays in these sorts of ways can lead
      to poor performance.".)
    * Record pattern matching: specify a binder on the right


### Guards

    gcd n m | n > m     = gcd (n-m) m
            | otherwise = gcd n (m-n)


Libs and Patterns
-----------------

### Functions

* Prelude
** (#)                  Reverse of ($), e.g.:
                        `products # filter isInStock # groupBy style # head`
** (<$>), (<#>)         Infix `map` and reversed args
** (<<<), (>>>)         Function (Semigroupoid) composition


### Functors

    class Functor f where
        map :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> f a -> f b


This does the obvious thing for lists, but also can be used to lift
functions into operations on, e.g., Maybe:

    map show [17, 21, 22]
    map show Nothing
    map show (Just 17)
    map show $ head [17, 21, 22]

Or for Tuples (pairs), we update the second entry:

    instance functorTuple :: Functor (Tuple a) where
        map f (Tuple x y) = Tuple x (f y)

Those can all be viewed as "containers" of course, but how about for
functions?
  XXX I don't understand the ((->) r) below, which is maybe why I
don't understand how this works.

    class Semigroupoid a where
        compose :: forall b c d. a c d -> a b c -> a b d
    instance semigroupoidFn :: Semigroupoid (->) where
        compose f g x = f (g x)
    - f :: c -> d,  g :: b -> c;  compose gives us b -> d

    class Functor f where
        map :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
    instance functorFn :: Functor ((->) r) where
        map = compose
